# ICLR 2020 - Keyword Analysis

This repository contains a Colab Notebook for you to see some data on accepted papers at ICLR2020. The notebook will output a bar chart of Number of Papers per Keyword in descending order.

The data was taken from [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2020/Conference) from the "Posters", "Spotlights" and "Oral Presentations" tabs.

The code will output bar charts for each type of paper.

You can threshold the minimum number of papers for a keyword to be included as well as the number of keywords shown.

You can choose whether to display the "Others" keyword which groups all keywords below the threshold.
